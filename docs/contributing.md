# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing towards Dashy! üôå
There are several ways that you can help out (but don't feel you have to). 
Any contributions, every contribution, however small will always be very much appreciated, and you will be appropriately credited in the readme - huge thank you to everyone who has helped so far.

## Submit a PR
Contributing to the code or documentation is super helpful. You can fix a bug, add a new feature or improve an existing one. I've written [several guides](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/development-guides.md) with step-by-step tutorials of common tasks within Dashy. And I've tried to keep the code neat and documentation thorough, so understanding what everything does should be fairly straight forward, but feel free to ask if you have any questions.

## Add Translations
If you speak another language, then adding translations would be really helpful, and you will be credited in the readme for your work. Multi-language support makes Dashy accessible for non-English speakers, which I feel is important. This is a very quick and easy task, , as all application text is located in [`locales/en.json`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/assets/locales/en.json), so adding a new language is as simple as copying this file and translating the values. You don't have to translate it all, as any missing attributes will just fallback to English. For a full tutorial, see the [Translating Docs](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/development-guides.md#adding-translations).


## Raise a bug
If you've found a bug, then please do raise it as an issue. This will help me know if there's something that needs fixing. Try and include as much detail as possible, such as your environment, steps to reproduce, any console output and maybe an example screenshot or recording if necessary. You can [Raise a Bug here](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/issues/new?assignees=Lissy93&labels=%F0%9F%90%9B+Bug&template=bug-report---.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) üêõ.

## Join the discussion
I've enabled the discussion feature on GitHub, here you can share tips and tricks, useful information, or your dashboard. You can also ask questions, and offer basic support to other users.

## Share your dashboard
Dashy now has a [Showcase](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/showcase.md#dashy-showcase-) where you can show off a screenshot of your dashboard, and get inspiration from other users. I also really enjoy seeing how people are using Dashy. To [submit your dashboard](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/showcase.md#submitting-your-dashboard), please either open a PR or raise an issue.

## Spread the word
Dashy is still a relatively young project, and as such not many people know of it. It would be great to see more users, and so it would be awesome if you could consider sharing on social platforms.

## Leave a review
Dashy is on the following platforms, and if you could spare a few seconds to give it an upvote or review, this will also help new users find it.
- [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/dashy)
- DockerHub
- GitHub

## Make a small donation

Please only do this is you can definitely afford to. Don't feel any pressure to donate anything, as Dashy and my other projects will always be 100% free, for everyone, for ever.
