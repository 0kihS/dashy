> A static site linking to all running services for networking, management and monitoring

## Developing üß±

Project structure is fairly standard, to run it locally, just `git clone`, `cd` into it, `yarn install` the dependencies, and then run one of the following:

- `yarn run dev` - Starts dev server, with hot-reload, and diff-linting
- `yarn run build` - Compiles and minifies for production
- `yarn run start` - Will serve up the **built**  production app from the `dist` dir
- `yarn run lint` - Lints and fixes files
- `yarn run test` - Runs all tests

---

## Configuring

- Data for the tiles is specified in [`src/data/item-data.json`](https://github.com/Lissy93/server-start-page/blob/master/src/data/item-data.json).
- Image assets are stored in [`public/img/item-icons/`](https://github.com/Lissy93/server-start-page/tree/master/public/img/item-icons), you can either use font-awesome, the pre-configured gradient icons, or add your own.
- The color scheme is defined as SCSS variables in [`src/styles/color-pallet.scss`](https://github.com/Lissy93/server-start-page/blob/master/src/styles/color-pallet.scss).
