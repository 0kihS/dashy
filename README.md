## Getting Started üõ´

> For full setup instructions, see: [**Getting Started**](./docs/getting-started.md)

#### Deploying from Docker Hub üê≥

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system

```docker
docker run -d \
  -p 4000:80 \
  -v /root/my-local-conf.yml:/app/public/conf.yml \
  --name my-dashboard \
  --restart=always \
  lissy93/dashy:latest
```
After making changes to your configuration file, you will need to run: `docker exec -it [container-id] yarn build` to rebuild. You can also run other commands, such as `yarn validate-config` this way too. Container ID can be found by running `docker ps`. Healthchecks are pre-configured to monitor the uptime and response times of Dashy, and the status of which can be seen in the container logs, e.g. `docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health }}" [container-id]`.

#### Deploying from Source üöÄ

You will need both [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and the latest or LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system

- Get Code: `git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/dashy.git` and `cd dashy`
- Configuration: Fill in you're settings in `./public/conf.yml`
- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Build: `yarn build`
- Run: `yarn start`

After making changes to your configuration file, you will need to run: `yarn build` to rebuild. 

#### Deploy to the Cloud

Dashy supports 1-Click deployments on several popular cloud platforms (with more on the way!). To get started, just click a link below:

## Configuring üîß

> For full configuration documentation, see: [**Configuring**](./docs/configuring.md)

Dashy is configured with a single [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file, located at `./public/conf.yml` (or `./app/public/conf.yml` for Docker). Any other optional user-customizable assets are also located in the `./public/` directory, e.g. `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, `robots.txt` and `web-icons/*`. If you are using Docker, the easiest way to method is to mount a Docker volume (e.g. `-v /root/my-local-conf.yml:/app/public/conf.yml`)

In the production environment, the app needs to be rebuilt in order for changes to take effect. This can be done with `yarn build`, or `docker exec -it [container-id] yarn build` if you are using Docker (where container ID can be found by running `docker ps`).

You can check that your config matches Dashy's [schema](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/utils/ConfigSchema.json) before deploying, by running `yarn validate-config.`

You may find these [example config](https://gist.github.com/Lissy93/000f712a5ce98f212817d20bc16bab10) helpful for getting you started

## Theming üé®

> For full configuration documentation, see: [**Theming**](./docs/theming.md)

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://i.ibb.co/BVSHV1v/dashy-themes-slideshow.gif">
    <img alt="Example Themes" src="/docs/assets/theme-slideshow.gif" width="400">
  </a>
</p>

The app comes with a number of built-in themes, but it's also easy to write you're own. All colors, and most other CSS properties make use of CSS variables, which makes customizing the look and feel of Dashy very easy.

You can also apply custom CSS overrides directly through the UI (Under Config menu --> Custom CSS), or specify it in your config file under `appConfig.customCss`. If you have a lot of custom styles, you can pass in the path to a stylesheet, in `appConfig.externalStyleSheet`.

## Cloud Backup & Sync ‚òÅ

> For full documentation, see: [**Cloud Backup & Sync**](./docs/backup-restore.md)

Dashy has an **optional** built-in feature for securely backing up your config to a hosted cloud service, and then restoring it on another instance. This feature is totally optional, and if you do not enable it, then Dashy will not make any external network requests.

This is useful not only for backing up your configuration off-site, but it also enables Dashy to be used without having write a YAML config file, and makes it possible to use a public hosted instance, without the need to self-host.

All data is encrypted before being sent to the backend. In Dashy, this is done in [`CloudBackup.js`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/utils/CloudBackup.js), using [crypto.js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js)'s AES method, using the users chosen password as the key. The data is then sent to a [Cloudflare worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works) (a platform for running serverless functions), and stored in a [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-kv-works) data store.

## Developing üß±

> For full development documentation, see: [**Developing**](./docs/developing.md)

1. Get Code: `git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/dashy.git`  and `cd dashy`
2. Install dependencies: `yarn`
3. Start dev server: `yarn dev`

Hot reload is enabled, so changes will be detected automatically, triggering the app to be rebuilt and refreshed. Ensure that all lint checks and tests are passing before pushing an code or deploying the app.

If you are new to Vue.js or web development and want to learn more, [here are some resources](docs/developing.md#resources-for-beginners) to help get you started. Dashy is a pretty straight-forward application, so would make an ideal candidate for your first PR!

## Credits üèÜ

### Contributors üë•

![Auto-generated contributors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/CONTRIBUTORS.svg)

### Dependencies üîó

This app definitely wouldn't have been quite so possible without the making use of the following package and components. Full credit and big kudos to their respective authors, who've done an amazing job in building and maintaining them.

##### Core
At it's core, the application uses [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), as well as it's services. Styling is done with [SCSS](https://github.com/sass/sass), JavaScript is currently [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel), (but I am in the process of converting to [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)), linting is done with [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint), the config is defined in [YAML](https://github.com/yaml/yaml), and there is a simple [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) server to serve up the static app.

##### Frontend Components
- [`vue-select`](https://github.com/sagalbot/vue-select) - Dropdown component by @sagalbot `MIT`
- [`vue-js-modal`](https://github.com/euvl/vue-js-modal) - Modal component by @euvl `MIT`
- [`v-tooltip`](https://github.com/Akryum/v-tooltip) - Tooltip component by @Akryum `MIT`
- [`vue-material-tabs`](https://github.com/jairoblatt/vue-material-tabs) - Tab view component by @jairoblatt `MIT`
- [`VJsoneditor`](https://github.com/yansenlei/VJsoneditor) - Interactive JSON editor component by @yansenlei `MIT`
  - Forked from [`JsonEditor`](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor) by @josdejong `Apache-2.0 License`
- [`vue-toasted`](https://github.com/shakee93/vue-toasted) - Toast notification component by @shakee93 `MIT`
- [`vue-prism-editor`](https://github.com/koca/vue-prism-editor) - Lightweight code editor by @koca `MIT`
  - Forked from [`prism.js`](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) `MIT`

##### Utilities
- [`crypto-js`](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js) - Encryption implementations by @evanvosberg and community `MIT`
- [`axios`](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client by @mzabriskie and community `MIT`
- [`ajv`](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv) - JSON schema Validator by @epoberezkin and community `MIT`

##### Backup & Sync Server
Although the app is purely frontend, there is an optional cloud backup and restore feature. This is built as a serverless function on [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) using [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv) and [web crypto](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-crypto)

##### External Services
The 1-Click deploy demo uses [Play-with-Docker Labs](https://play-with-docker.com/). Code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com), Docker image is hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/), and the demos are hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Alternatives üôå

There are a few self-hosted web apps, that serve a similar purpose to Dashy. If you're looking for a dashboard, and Dashy doesn't meet your needs, I highly recommend you check these projects out! Including, but not limited to: [HomeDash2](https://lamarios.github.io/Homedash2), [Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) (`Apache License 2.0`), [Organizr](https://organizr.app/) (`GPL-3.0 License`) and  [Heimdall](https://github.com/linuxserver/Heimdall) (`MIT License`)
