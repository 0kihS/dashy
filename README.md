## Configuring üîß

### Config Locations

Configuration files are located in `./public/`.
- `./public/conf.yml` - This is the main site configuration file, and is required for the app to work
- `./public/item-icons` - If you're using custom icons for your items, then store these here. You can use sub-folders to keep things organised
- `./public/logo.png` - Optionally add a logo image for you're website, which will show in the top left

Also within `./public` you'll find normal website assets, including `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, `robots.txt` and `web-icons/*`. There's no need to modify these, but you can do so if you wish.
