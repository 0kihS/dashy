## Configuring üîß

### Config Locations üìç

Configuration files are located in [`./public/`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master/public).
- `./public/conf.yml` - This is the main site configuration file, and is required for the app to work
- `./public/item-icons` - If you're using your own icons, you can choose to store them locally for better load time. You can also use sub-folders to keep things organized

Also within `./public` you'll find normal website assets, including `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, `robots.txt` and `web-icons/*`. There's no need to modify these, but you can do so if you wish.

### The Conf File üìÑ

All app config is specified in [`/public/conf.yml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/public/conf.yml) (in [YAML Format](https://yaml.org/)).
All fields are optional, unless otherwise stated.

**Example Configs**: https://gist.github.com/Lissy93/000f712a5ce98f212817d20bc16bab10

**`pageInfo`**
- `title` - String: The page title and heading
- `description` - String: Short description visible under the heading
- `navLinks` - Array: Links to display in the nav bar, an array or objects containing a title and link:
  - `title` - String: Text to display
  - `path` - String: URL or relative link
- `footerText` - String: Text to display in the footer

**`appConfig`** _(optional)_
- `backgroundImg` - String: Path to an optional full-screen app background image. This can be either remote (http) or local (/). Note that this will slow down initial load
- `enableFontAwesome` - Boolean: Where `true` is enabled, if left blank font-awesome will be enabled only if required by 1 or more icons
- `fontAwesomeKey` - String: If you have a font-awesome key, then you can use it here and make use of premium icons. It is a 10-digit alpha-numeric string from you're FA kit URL  (e.g. `13014ae648`)
- `customCss` - String: Raw CSS that will be applied to the page. Please minify it first.
- `theme`- String: The default theme for first load (you can change this later from the UI)
- `cssThemes` - String[]: An array of custom theme names which can be used in the theme switcher dropdown - _See **theming** below_
- `externalStyleSheet` - String or String[] - Either a URL to an external stylesheet or an array or URLs, which can be applied as themes within the UI

**`sections`** - Section[]: (required) An array of sections - _See **`section`** below_

**`section`**
- `name` - String: (required) The title of that section
- `items` - Item[]: (required) An array of items - _See **`item`** below_
- `displayData`: An object with the following fields (all optional)
  - `collapsed` - Boolean: If true, the section will  be collapsed initially (defaults to `false`) 
  - `color` - String: A custom accent color for the section, as a hex code or HTML color (e.g. `#fff`)
  - `customStyles` - String: Custom CSS properties that should be applied to that section, e.g. `border: 2px dashed #ff0000;`
  - `itemSize` - String: Specify the size for items within this group, either `small`, `medium` or `large`
  - `rows` - Int: Number of rows the section should span vertically, e.g. 2 (defaults to `1`)
  - `cols` - Int: Number of columns the section should span horizontally, e.g. 2 (defaults to `1`)
  - `layout` - Enum: `auto` or `grid`. If `grid` is selected, then the number of items per row can be set
  - `itemCountX` - Int: Number of items horizontally (for `layout: grid`)
  - `itemCountY` - Int: Number of items vertically (for `layout: grid`)

Note about `rows` and `cols`: These are defined as a proportion of the screen (rather than by number of child items), and is built using [`grid-layout`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout). For more info, see [this example](https://i.ibb.co/HXRWVRK/how-rows-and-cols-work-in-dashy.png). In order to set the number of items that will display horizontally or vertically within a section, first set `display: grid`, and then specify values for `itemCountX`, and optionally `itemCountY`.

**`item`**
- `title` - String: The text to display on the item
- `description` - String: Additional info which is shown in the tooltip on hover
- `icon` - String: Icons can be either a local image, remote image, or a Font Awesome icon,  *see below for more info*
- `url` - String: The full path to be opened on click (e.g. `https://example.com`)
- `target` - String: The method in which the item will be opened, either `newtab`, `sametab` or `iframe`
- `color` - String: A custom color the the item, as a hex code or HTML color (e.g. `#fff`)
- `backgroundColor` - String: A custom fill color for the the item's background, also as a hex code

**`icon`** Examples:
- To use use a remote image, just use it's full URL, e.g. `https://i.ibb.co/710B3Yc/space-invader-x256.png`
- To use a local image, save it in `./public/item-icons/image.png` or  `./public/my-category/item-icons/image.png` and specify the image as `image.png` or `my-category/image.png`. For best results, use either png or svg formats.
- To automatically fetch an icon from items URL, just set icon field to `favicon`
- To use a Font-Awesome icon, specify the category (`fas`, `fab`, `far`, `fal` or`fad`), followed by a space then `fa-` and the icon name. For example: `fas fa-rocket`, `fab fa-monero`, `fal fa-duck` or `fad fa-glass-whiskey-rocks`. Note that light (`fal`) and duotone (`fad`) icons are only available with Font Awesome Pro, to use this, you need to set you're kit ID under `appConfig.fontAwesomeKey`.


### Theming üé®

The app comes with a number of built-in themes, but it's also easy to write you're own. Once you've done so you can select you're theme fro the dropdown menu, and like other visual settings, you're chosen theme is saved in local storage, so will load automatically when you next visit the page.

The theme switching is done by simply changing the `data-theme` attribute on the root DOM element, which can then be targeted by CSS. First off, in order for the theme to show up in the theme switcher, it needs to be added to the config file, under `appConfig.cssThemes`, either as a string, or an array of strings for multiple themes. For example:

```yaml
appConfig:
  cssThemes: ['tiger', 'another-theme']
```

You can now create a block to target you're theme with `html[data-theme='my-theme']{}` and set some styles. The easiest method is by setting CSS variables, but you can also directly override elements by their selector. As an example, see the [built-in CSS themes](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/styles/color-themes.scss).

```css
html[data-theme='tiger'] {
  --primary: #f58233;
  --item-group-background: #0b1021;
}
```
Alternatively, you can load an external stylesheet. Pass either a URL to a .css file, or an array or URLs to `appConfig.externalStyleSheet`. The stylesheet will then be pre-loaded, and can then be enabled from the UI using the theme switcher.

```yaml
appConfig:
  externalStyleSheet: 'https://example.com/my-stylesheet.css'
```

## Notes
### Roadmap üõ£

- [ ] Allow users to import / export configuration through the UI
- [ ] Improve deployment process (with a one-liner Docker run command)
- [ ] Add support for custom widgets
- [ ] Convert JavaScript to TypeScript

### Alternatives üôå

And the app itself is built with [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) ![vue-logo](https://i.ibb.co/xqKW6h5/vue-logo.png)

Although the app is purely frontend, there is an optional cloud backup and restore feature. This is built as a serverless function on [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) using [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv) and [web crypto](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-crypto)
