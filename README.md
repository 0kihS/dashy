## Configuring üîß

### Config Locations üìç

Configuration files are located in [`./public/`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master/public).
- `./public/conf.yml` - This is the main site configuration file, and is required for the app to work
- `./public/item-icons` - If you're using your own icons, you can choose to store them locally for better load time. You can also use sub-folders to keep things organized

Also within `./public` you'll find normal website assets, including `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, `robots.txt` and `web-icons/*`. There's no need to modify these, but you can do so if you wish.

### The Conf File üìÑ

All app config is specified in [`/public/conf.yml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/public/conf.yml) (in [YAML Format](https://yaml.org/)).

- `url` - String: The full path to be opened on click (e.g. `https://example.com`)
- `target` - String: The method in which the item will be opened, either `newtab`, `sametab` or `iframe`

- `backgroundColor` - String: A custom fill color for the the item's background, also as a hex code

**`icon`** Examples:
- To use use a remote image, just use it's full URL, e.g. `https://i.ibb.co/710B3Yc/space-invader-x256.png`
- To use a local image, save it in `./public/item-icons/image.png` or  `./public/my-category/item-icons/image.png` and specify the image as `image.png` or `my-category/image.png`. For best results, use either png or svg formats.
- To automatically fetch an icon from items URL, just set icon field to `favicon`

For example: `fas fa-rocket`, `fab fa-monero`, `fal fa-duck` or `fad fa-glass-whiskey-rocks`. Note that light (`fal`) and duotone (`fad`) icons are only available with Font Awesome Pro, to use this, you need to set you're kit ID under `appConfig.fontAwesomeKey`.


### Theming üé®

The app comes with a number of built-in themes, but it's also easy to write you're own. Once you've done so you can select you're theme fro the dropdown menu, and like other visual settings, you're chosen theme is saved in local storage, so will load automatically when you next visit the page.

The theme switching is done by simply changing the `data-theme` attribute on the root DOM element, which can then be targeted by CSS. First off, in order for the theme to show up in the theme switcher, it needs to be added to the config file, under `appConfig.cssThemes`, either as a string, or an array of strings for multiple themes. For example:

```yaml
appConfig:
  cssThemes: ['tiger', 'another-theme']
```

You can now create a block to target you're theme with `html[data-theme='my-theme']{}` and set some styles. The easiest method is by setting CSS variables, but you can also directly override elements by their selector. As an example, see the [built-in CSS themes](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/styles/color-themes.scss).

```css
html[data-theme='tiger'] {
  --primary: #f58233;
  --item-group-background: #0b1021;
}
```
Alternatively, you can load an external stylesheet. Pass either a URL to a .css file, or an array or URLs to `appConfig.externalStyleSheet`. The stylesheet will then be pre-loaded, and can then be enabled from the UI using the theme switcher.

```yaml
appConfig:
  externalStyleSheet: 'https://example.com/my-stylesheet.css'
```
